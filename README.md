This project is a WordPress theme that I built from scratch for a new freight/logistics company. Unfortunately, the company went under before the site was actually finished and launched.

This project is tied to my other repository job-app_plugin, which supplies the functionality to the /inc/form files and the page-apply.php file.

Although the site itself is not production ready, I did spend a lot of time testing the form, which was the main purpose of the website. The majority of code that deals with the job form is located in the job-app_plugin repo.
